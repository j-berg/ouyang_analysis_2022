YPL281C	0.0						ERR2	Enolase, a phosphopyruvate hydratase; catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate; complements the growth defect of an ENO1 ENO2 double mutant
YPL282C	0.0						PAU22	Protein of unknown function; member of the seripauperin multigene family encoded mainly in subtelomeric regions; SWAT-GFP fusion protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and vacuole, while mCherry fusion localizes to just the vacuole; identical to Pau21p; encodes two proteins that are translated from two different start codons
YPL283C	0.0						YRF1-7	Helicase encoded by the Y' element of subtelomeric regions; highly expressed in the mutants lacking the telomerase component TLC1; potentially phosphorylated by Cdc28p
